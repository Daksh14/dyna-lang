# Project Development Plan
## Objective
Develop a programming language with functional components including a lexer, parser, type checker, and runtime execution environment.

## Team Roles
Project Manager: Oversees timeline, deliverables, and team coordination.
Language Guru: Defines language syntax, semantics, and evolution.
System Architect: Designs the core architecture of the language's components.
Systems Integrator: Ensures integration of all modules and oversees runtime environment.
Tester: Develops test plans and ensures functionality through rigorous testing.
Milestones
## Phase 1: Planning

Define project objectives and assign roles.
Create initial language specification and architecture design.

## Phase 2: Development

Implement lexer .
Build syntax tree and type-checking module.
Develop runtime and development environment.

## Phase 3: Testing

Develop test cases for all modules.
Conduct integration and unit testing.

## Phase 4: Documentation and Delivery

Finalize whitepaper, reference manual, and tutorial.
Compile code and create installation instructions.
Tools and Technologies
Language: Rust (based on provided files).
Version Control: Git.
Collaboration: Slack/Teams for communication.
Risks and Mitigation
Risk: Delay in integration.
Mitigation: Schedule mid-phase testing.
Risk: Undefined syntax causing errors.
Mitigation: Frequent reviews of the language specification.
